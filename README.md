# angular-dev-challenge

## TODOs:

* Build a giphy search tool that let's the user search gifs by using giphys search api (see [API docs](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/#operation--gifs-search-get)).
* List all found gifs as you like
* The user should then be able to store the best gifs locally as hers/his favorites (no database/server or offline support required!)
* List all favorite gifs of the user and make them removable

## Rules

* Structure your application by using components and services
* Store the favorite gifs locally. Pick any storage technology you like und you find useful. Use a service to store and retrieve the stored gifs
* Use angular router if necessary (already pre configured)
* You may add any UI/UX library you like (Bootstrap, Material UI, ...)
* Provide a nice and easy to use UI/UX
